## üîπ Analysis Tasks & Visualizations

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Employee Distribution Across Teams**
- Counted the number of employees in each team.
- Used a **bar chart** to visualize the distribution.
- **Insight:** Some teams have significantly more employees than others.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Employee Segregation Based on Positions**
- Categorized employees by job positions.
- Used a **pie chart** to show the proportion of each role.
- **Insight:** Some positions have fewer employees, indicating possible hiring gaps.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Predominant Age Group Among Employees**
- Grouped employees into age categories (18-25, 26-35, etc.).
- Used a **bar chart** to identify the most common age group.
- **Insight:** The **26-35 age group** is the largest, indicating a younger workforce.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Team & Position with Highest Salary Expenditure**
- Calculated total salary distribution across teams and positions.
- Used **bar charts** to visualize the expenditure.
- **Insight:** The **highest-paid team and position** consume a major portion of the salary budget.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation Between Age and Salary**
- Examined if age influences salary levels.
- Used a **scatter plot** and calculated the correlation coefficient.
- **Insight:** There is a **moderate positive correlation**, suggesting experience plays a role in salary.

## üìä Visualizations
Each of the above tasks includes **appropriate visualizations** using **Matplotlib and Seaborn** for better data interpretation.

 Project Insights 
‚úÖ Some teams have **disproportionately high** employee counts, which may affect workload balance.
‚úÖ Certain job positions appear **understaffed**, requiring further recruitment.
‚úÖ The **salary distribution is concentrated** in a few high-paying teams and roles.
‚úÖ There is **a moderate correlation between age and salary**, indicating that experience affects pay but is not the only factor.
